LyqydNet APIs:

1 - Setup

To install, simply copy the files to their appropriate directories.

Each computer that you want to be on the network should have this added
to its startup (see 3.1 - 3.4 for more information):

shell.run("modread")
shell.run("netd")
net.netInit()

Routers need an additional line:

shell.run("modread")
shell.run("netd")
shell.run("routed")
net.netInit()

2 - APIs

2.1 - Connection API

The connection API is the application-layer rednet interface in
LyqydNet. It provides an easy way to set up client-server applications
rapidly and with minimal effort. This layer abstracts away most tech-
nical aspects of formatting and delivering rednet packets so that the
small details are gotten out of the developer's way.

2.1.1 - connection.open()

The open function takes three arguments; a computer identification
string, a socket number, and a timeout duration. To connect to a
computer named "fileserver" running the "filed" program (which uses
socket 21), for example, one would call:

serverConnection = connection.open("fileserver", 21, 2)

This will send a packet to the computer specified, requesting to connect
to the server. If a server is available there, it will respond. If a
response is received before the timeout has expired, open() will create
the connection information and return a connection number. This con-
nection number will then be used in all communication between client and
server.

2.1.2 - connection.send()

The send function takes three arguments; a connection number, a message
type, and a message to send. Most communications to a server are sent
using the "data" message type. For example,

connection.send(serverConnection, "data", "Hello, Server!")

2.1.3 - connection.close()

The close function takes three arguments; a connection number, an
optional message, and an optional 'quiet' value. If no message is pro-
vided, the message "disconnect" will automatically be used. If the quiet
option is true, no closing packet will be send to the connection.
Normally, one would use the close function in quiet mode after receiving
a connection close message from a client computer. An example of a
client disconnecting:

connection.close(serverConnection)

2.1.4 - connection.awaitResponse()

The awaitResponse function takes two arguments; a connection to listen
for a response on and a timeout duration. If no response is received
before the timer runs out, awaitResponse returns false. Otherwise, it
returns the message type and message received on the connection, as well
as the distance from the sender (if the packet was not forwarded from a
router in between). An example of a real use for awaitResponse:

local messageType, message = nil, nil
while messageType ~= "done" do
	messageType, message = connection.awaitResponse(serverConnection)
	if messageType == "close" then
		print("Connection closed by server.")
		return
	elseif messageType == "data" then
		print("Server sent: "..message)
	else
	end
end

2.1.5 - connection.lessResponse()

Read as "connectionless response", this close cousin of awaitResponse()
does just that--listens for any sort of response. This is used for
things such as a GPS implementation, where multiple responses to a
single query must be gathered and processed. This function returns the
same as awaitResponse does. It does not return any information about
the origin of the response packets (aside from the distance, of course).

2.1.6 - connection.broadcast()

The broadcast function takes three arguments; a message type, a message,
and an optional server string (identical to the server identifier used
in connection.open()). It will broadcast the assembled packet to all
computers in range.  For example:

connection.broadcast("query", "connect", "gpsd")

2.1.7 - connection.listen()

The listen function is used by foreground servers (the computer is only
running the server) to listen for incoming packets and connections. It
takes two arguments; the socket number and an optional timeout duration.
The socket number provided to this call is used to check incoming
connection requests (from connection.open()), so it is imperative that
they match. The listen function returns a connection number, a message
type, and a message. For example, a file server might use:

clientConnection, messageType, message = connection.listen(21)

2.1.8 - connection.listenIdle()

The listenIdle function is used by background servers (a separate co-
routine resumed as necessary based on network traffic). The listenIdle
function is mostly a wrapper for the coroutine.yield() function. See
2.2.13 for more information on how data is given to background servers.
The listenIdle function is also called with a socket number (but not a
timeout duration, as it will pass control away until a packet is
received) returns exactly the same information as the listen function;
a connection number, a message type, and a message.

2.1.9 - connection.isTurtle()

The isTurtle function takes only one argument; a connection number. It
returns true if the computer the connection refers to is a turtle, false
if it isn't, and nil if the connection number isn't currently valid.

2.1.10 - connection.name()

The name function is very similar to the isTurtle function; it takes a
single argument (a connection number) and returns false if it is not a
valid connection number, otherwise it returns the name of the computer.

2.1.11 - connection.route()

The route function is identical to the name function, except that it
returns the route number of the computer if a valid connection number is
provided.

2.2 - Net API

The Net API is the layer that the connection API is built on. This layer
handles the sending and receiving of packets, as well as delivering them
to the running server applications, network daemons and client programs.
Full documentation is provided, but many functions of this API are
intended for use only by other APIs.

2.2.1 - net.netInit()

This function takes no arguments. The netInit function is crucial to the
LyqydNet system. It must be called in startup on every computer that
will be on the network. This makes it discoverable to routers and other
computers on the network. Each computer must be labeled before it can be
added to the network. Computer labels are used as hostnames. This
function sends out basic information about the computer in a broadcast.

2.2.2 - net.daemonAdd()

This function takes three arguments; a daemon name, a function and a
socket number. The function is used to create a coroutine which will be
resumed every time a packet is received for the daemon on that socket.
Daemons are background servers. See 2.1.1, 2.1.7, 2.1.8 for more
information on socket numbers.

2.2.3 - net.daemonRemove()

This function removes a daemon from the daemon table, so that it can no
longer receive packets. It takes one argument; the daemon name. If the
daemon was present, this function returns true; otherwise, it returns
false.

2.2.4 - net.routeFromName()

This function takes the name of a computer as an argument and returns
the route number associated with it.

2.2.5 - net.routeFromCID()

This function takes the ID number of a computer as an argument and
returns the route number associated with it.

2.2.6 - net.nameFromRoute()

This function takes a route number as an argument and returns the name
of the computer associated with it.

2.2.7 - CIDFromRoute()

This function takes a route number as an argument and returns the ID of
the computer associated with it.

2.2.8 - net.packet_send()

This function takes a packet type, a route number, and a message and
sends a packet. Use (2.1.2) connection.send() instead.

2.2.9 - net.packet_receive()

This function takes an ID number and a raw packet and returns a route
number, a packet type, and the packet data. Use one of the listening
functions in the connection API instead (2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.1.7, 2.1.8)

2.2.10 - net.add_route()

This function takes an ID number, computer type, computer name, gateway
and cost and adds a route to the route table. Do not manually call this
function.

2.2.11 - net.remove_route()

This function takes a route number and removes it from the routing table
and the hosts file. Do not manually call this function.

2.2.12 - net.localprint()

Wraps the print function so that background servers can write text to
the screen (using print() only!) without mangling the command-line if it
is in use. This function is automatically called instead of the default
print() when called inside a background server, so they may use print()
as normal and it will "just work".

2.2.13 - net.rednet_message()

A direct handler for the rednet_message event.  This function is passed
the id, packet, and distance given by the rednet_message event from
os.pullEvent(). Forwarded packets are automatically processed (unwrapped
from encapsulation if they have reached the destination, otherwise sent
to routed (the routing daemon) if it is running), packets with network
information are sent to either the routing daemon or the network daemon.
Packets intended for servers are checked against the list of running
background servers. All other packets are simply returned in route
number, packet type, packet data format.

This function is how packets get to individual programs correctly. A
computer could theoretically be running many servers, and as long as all
of them were written properly, there would be no problems with packets
being misdelivered. Background servers should NEVER wait for packets
any other way than coroutine.yield(). They must use their own variables
to remember any state information they need to keep track of, so they
do not interfere with other background servers.

Foreground servers will receive packets being returned by rednet_message
whether they are intended for the server or not (except, of course, for
any packets sent to a running background server), so the connection API
is used to filter out those wayward packets.

2.3 - Net File API

The netfile API is used to greatly simplify the exchange of files across
the LyqydNet network.

2.3.1 - netfile.get()

The get function takes four arguments; a connection number, a remote
file to get, a local file to save the remote file to, and a timeout. If
the connection number refers to a connection that doesn't exist, it will
return false. Otherwise, it will request the file and then return with a
call to netfile.receive(). See 2.3.2 in regards to using this in a
server application.

2.3.2 - netfile.receive()

The receive function takes three arguments; a connection number, a local
file to save the incoming data to, and a timeout. It will return false
if the connection number refers to a connection that doesn't exist, or
if it times out before the file is received. Otherwise, it will return
the file header (contains the name of the remote file).

Only foreground servers should use netfile.receive() (and netfile.get(),
since it uses netfile.receive()) for reasons discussed in 2.2.13. Since
they wait for packets without using coroutine.yield, they will not work
properly (or at all) in background servers. Background servers wishing
to receive files should instead catch the fileData message type (saving
each line to a table) and the fileEnd message type (write the table to
the file).

2.3.3 - netfile.put()

The put function takes four arguments; a connection number, a local file
to send, a remote file location to save it to, and a timeout duration.
It sends a packet requesting to upload the file and awaits a response.
If a response allowing the upload is received before the timeout, the
function calls netfile.send() to send the file and returns whatever send
returns. If the local file doesn't exist, or the connection doesn't
exist, or if a bad response is received, put() will return false.

2.3.4 - netfile.send()

The send function takes two arguments; a connection number and a local
file to send. If the connection number refers to a connection that does
not exist, or if the local file does not exist, send() will return
false. Otherwise, it will send a file header packet containing the local
name of the file, the file data one line per packet, and finally a file
end packet. It will then return true.

3 - Programs

3.1 - modread

This program modifies read() so that it will utilize incoming rednet
messages. It also adds the use of the Home, End and Delete keys for the
command line. This program should be run at startup before everything
else.

shell.run("modread")

3.2 - netd

This program is the network daemon. It establishes and maintains the
routing table and responds to network information packets. This program
should be run second. It will automatically establish the network daemon
in the daemon table.

shell.run("netd")

3.3 - routed

This program is the routing daemon. It maintains lists of hosts and is
the backbone of the network. Each router will forward packets onto other
routers, using the most efficient known route to pass packets on to
their destinations. Routers are used to create networks larger than the
maximum rednet transmission distance by repeating packets onward.

They send the list of hosts on the network to computers joining the
network. New hosts will then direct all of their traffic through the
router until they discover shorter routes (peer connections cannot be
made until the first peer has rebooted; this is to minimize lag).

Routers can be made to work across great distances by using the longlink
instruction. Longlink routers will hold onto packets forwarded through
them until the next router confirms receipt of the packet. As the chain
of routers is walked past, each router in line comes online. When a
router comes online, longlink routers check whether there are any
packets waiting to be sent to it for forwarding. If so, all packets for
it are sent onward.

This process repeats all the way across the usually-unloaded chunks to
the other end of the network. Longlink is not the default behavior for
routers because it causes twice the packets to be sent each time (one
for data, one for confirmation). Routers that are normally in range of
each other should not be longlink routers.

The routing daemon should be started immediately after the network
daemon, if the computer will be a router.

shell.run("routed")

To make a router a longlink, router, send it an instruction:

coroutine.resume(net.daemonTable.routed, 0, "SI:longlink")

3.4 - net.netInit()

This isn't actually a program, but merely an API call. This call should
be made in startup only after modread, netd and, if applicable, routed
have already been started.

3.5 - netmon

Netmon is a network monitoring utility. It is relatively unpolished and
can easily temporarily break a computer if used incorrectly. It will
sometimes interfere with proper packet processing. Try running:

netmon start

on a router that handles a lot of traffic. You'll get to see your
network humming along!

4 - Examples

4.1 - Example Foreground Server

------------------------------------------------------------------------
local connections = {}

while true do
	--wait for input from client connections on socket 21.
	conn, messType, message = connection.listen(21)
	--okay, we have a packet, see if the connection is one we already
	--know about.
	if connections[conn] and connections[conn].status == "open" then
		--we can use additional entries in our 'connections' table
		--(which is internal to the server app) to store information
		--about client state, among other things.
		if messType == "data" then
			--handle client input here; use the connection number in
			--'conn' to send data back.
			print(message)
			connection.send(conn, "done", "OK")
			--break packet tells the client we are done transmitting
			--and are ready for the next command. This is optional. Some
			--types of servers wouldn't need to use this, e.g. a chat
			--server.
		elseif messType == "close" then
			--client has closed the connection, so let's close out
			--the connection information.
			connection.close(conn, disconnect, true)
			connections[conn].status = "closed"
			connections[conn].name = nil
		elseif messType == "instruction" then
			--these are local instructions. Often unused.
			if message == "stop" then
				return true
			end
		end
	elseif messType == "query" then
		--a client wants to open a connection
		if connections[conn] then
			--already have an entry for that connection number,
			--reset the information
			connections[conn].status = open
			connections[conn].name = connection.name(conn)
		else
			--no entry for this connection number, set up a new
			--entry.
			local connect = {}
			connect.status = "open"
			connect.name = connection.name(conn)
			table.insert(connections, conn, connect)
		end
		--either way we set up the connection, let the client know
		--it was successful.
		connection.send(conn, "response", "ok")
	end
end
------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 - Example background server

Note that this example is very similar to the previous example, the
foreground server. The critical difference here is that we use
connection.listenIdle() to get packets (which uses coroutine.yield()).
We also declare the server as a function, and then use net.daemonAdd to
add it to the daemon table.  Please note that the daemon name, "server"
is the same as the server identifier in the previous example, which is
in the connection.listen() call.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
local connections = {}

function serverFunction ()
	while true do
		--wait for input from client connections on socket 21.
		conn, messType, message = connection.listenIdle(21)
		--okay, we have a packet, see if the connection is one we
		--already know about.
		if connections[conn] and connections[conn].status == "open" then
			--we can use additional entries in our 'connections' table
			--(which is internal to the server app) to store information
			--about client state, among other things.
			if messType == "data" then
				--handle client input here; use the connection number in
				--'conn' to send data back.
				connection.send(conn, "done", "OK")
				--break packet tells the client we are done transmitting
				--and are ready for the next command.
			elseif messType == "close" then
				--client has closed the connection, so let's close out
				--the connection information.
				connection.close(conn, disconnect, true)
				connections[conn].status = "closed"
				connections[conn].name = nil
			elseif messType == "instruction" then
				--these are local instructions. Often unused.
				if message == "stop" then
					return true
				end
			end
		elseif messType == "query" then
			--a client wants to open a connection
			if connections[conn] then
				--already have an entry for that connection number,
				--reset the information
				connections[conn].status = open
				connections[conn].name = connection.name(conn)
			else
				--no entry for this connection number, set up a new
				--entry.
				local connect = {}
				connect.status = "open"
				connect.name = connection.name(conn)
				table.insert(connections, conn, connect)
			end
			--either way we set up the connection, let the client know
			--it was successful.
			connection.send(conn, "response", "ok")
		end
	end
end

--make sure the socket number here matches the socket number used above.
net.addDaemon("server", serverFunction, 21)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3 - Example Client

This client would, when run, open a command prompt. The command open,
with a server name, would open a connection to a server. The command
close would close the connection. The exit command would close the
connection if one was open, then exit the program. All other text would
be sent directly to the server application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
local tHistory = {}
local serverConnection = false
while true do
	write("client> ")
	local sLine = read(nil, tHistory)
	table.insert( tHistory, sLine )
	local commandArgs = {}
	for match in string.gmatch(sLine, "[^ \t]+") do
		table.insert( commandArgs, match )
	end
	if commandArgs[1] == "open" then
		if commandArgs[2] then
			serverConnection, remoteDir = connection.open(commandArgs[2], 21, 2)
			if not serverConnection then
				print("Connection Failed!")
			else
				print("Connected to "..commandArgs[2]..".")
			end
		else
			print("No server specified!")
		end
	elseif commandArgs[1] == "close" then
		if connection.close(serverConnection) then
			serverConnection = false
			print("Connection Closed.")
		else
			print("Could not close connection!")
		end
	elseif commandArgs[1] == "exit" then
		if serverConnection then connection.close(serverConnection) end
		return
	else
		connection.send(serverConnection, "data", sLine)
		local messageType, message = nil, nil
		while messageType ~= "done" do
			messageType, message = connection.awaitResponse(serverConnection)
			if messageType == "close" then
				print("Connection closed by server.")
				return
			elseif messageType == "data" then
				print("Server sent: "..message)
			else
			end
		end
	end
end
------------------------------------------------------------------------
